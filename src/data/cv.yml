        During my PhD in Acoustic Engineering applied to Biomedicine, I conducted advanced research:
      description:
        - Biomedical signal processing and acoustic analysis algorithms.
        - Ultrasound characterization for medical applications.
        - Computational modeling and simulation of acoustic phenomena.
        - Development of experimental methodologies for biomedical studies.
        - Publication of results in specialized conferences and journals.
        - "After nearly completing the doctoral program, I made the strategic decision to redirect my career toward industrial software development. This transition allowed me to apply my solid foundation in data analysis, programming, and analytical thinking to the software sector, where I found a more direct alignment between my technical skills and my long-term professional goals."
