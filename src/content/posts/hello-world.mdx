# Introduction

Keystatic is a new CMS that lives in your repo. It's built on top of Keystones.

It allows you to edit your content in a nice UI, and saves the data back to your repo as Markdown, JSON or YAML.

## Code Examples

Here is some standard code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```
