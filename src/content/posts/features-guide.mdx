Welcome to the feature showcase! This post serves as a living document and reference for all the content creation tools at your disposal. Whether you are writing a technical tutorial, a changelog, or a personal update, these elements will help you craft beautiful and engaging content.

## Typography & Formatting

We support standard Markdown formatting for emphasizing text. You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or even ~~strikethrough~~. You can also [add links](https://astro.build) to external resources.

### Headings

Headings help structure your content. The title of the post is the H1. Use H2 through H6 to organize your sections.

#### Level 4 Heading
##### Level 5 Heading
###### Level 6 Heading

> **Blockquotes** are perfect for highlighting key takeaways or quoting external sources. They stand out from the rest of the text.

## Interactive Components

We have integrated several custom components to enhance your posts.

### Callouts

Callouts are great for highlighting specific types of information. We support four variants:

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** This is an information callout. Use it for general notes or context settings.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Warning:** Proceed with caution! Use this for important warnings or potential pitfalls.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  **Error:** Something went wrong. Use this for error messages or critical alerts.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
  **Success:** Great job! Use this for successful actions or positive outcomes.
</Callout>

### Media Embeds

You can embed rich media directly into your posts.

#### YouTube Video

## Code & Syntax Highlighting

Technical content matches perfectly with our Expressive Code integration.

### Basic Code Block

```typescript
// A simple TypeScript function
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Code Tabs

For comparing or showing multiple files, use the `CodeTabs` component:

<CodeTabs>
  <CodeTabItem label="main.ts">
  ```typescript
  import { counter } from './counter';
  
  console.log(counter(5));
  ```
  </CodeTabItem>
  <CodeTabItem label="counter.ts">
  ```typescript
  export function counter(start: number) {
    return start + 1;
  }
  ```
  </CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Terminal Output

You can also simulate terminal sessions:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install astro
npm run dev
```

## Mathematics

If you need to display math equations, we support LaTeX syntax:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are:

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$
