# Prompts for Blog Images

## 1. Secure Nginx with Client Certificates (mTLS)

**Prompt:** A digital illustration representing Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. In the center, a secure Nginx server represented as a stylized server rack with a shield. On the left, a client device (laptop or phone) holding a digital certificate. Between them, a glowing handshake formed by data streams, symbolizing the secure connection. Background features abstract binary code and cryptographic keys. The style should be modern, tech-oriented, and professional, using a color palette of deep blues, teals, and accents of gold for the certificates.

## 2. Serve Virtual Files with Nginx

**Prompt:** A conceptual illustration of Nginx serving virtual files. In the center, the Nginx logo or a stylized server block. It is magically materializing documents like 'robots.txt', 'security.txt', and JSON files from thin air, bypassing a locked file cabinet labeled 'Web Root'. The background shows a schematic of a directory tree with some branches glowing. The style should be isometric, clean, and modern, with a palette of greens (Nginx brand), whites, and soft grays.

## 3. Mastering Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Prompt:** A high-tech illustration of Content Security Policy (CSP) in action. A futuristic Nginx shield is filtering a stream of incoming code blocks. Valid blocks with glowing 'Nonce' tokens pass through the shield, while malicious red 'XSS' bugs are zapped and rejected. In the background, a digital dashboard displays an 'A+' security rating and scrolling policy headers. The style should be cyber-security themed, with neon blue, green, and red accents against a dark background.
